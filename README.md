Hi there 👋 Welcome to my GitHub!
I'm Patience Edward – a software developer, tech enthusiast, and passionate young entrepreneur on a mission to blend innovation with sustainability 🌱💻.

🌍 About Me
🔭 I’m currently working on: Building a fun web app to help young coders find projects that match their skills and interests (think of it like a coding “dating app”!).

🌱 Learning: Always! My current focus is diving deeper into Django and refining my skills in UI/UX design.

🧠 Fun Fact: I’ve been working since I was 15 in public service and managed to launch a business around a product that’s the first of its kind in the market (hello, bitter leaf teabags!).

💬 Ask me about: Python, sustainable agriculture, or how I’m using tech to fight food insecurity. Or, ask me about my many pets 🐱.

🤝 Let’s Connect
Looking to collaborate on: Projects that merge technology with sustainability or anything to do with empowering communities through code.

📖 When I’m not coding or farming, I’m likely writing a thriller novel or working on my 'Code Quest: A Newbie's Handbook' for budding Python programmers.

🌍 I’m all about community, resilience, and innovation – inspired by my upbringing in the beautiful rural landscapes of South Africa.
Happy to have you here! 🚀 Dive in, and let’s build something amazing together.
